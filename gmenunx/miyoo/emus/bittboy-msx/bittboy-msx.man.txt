INTRODUCTION
------------

fMSX emulates MSX, MSX2, and MSX2+ 8bit home
computers. It runs MSX/MSX2/MSX2+ software on many
different platforms including Windows, MacOS, Unix,
MSDOS, AmigaOS, etc. 
See http://fms.komkon.org/fMSX/ for further
informations.

Dingux-MSX is a port on Dingoo of previous 
Gp2X-Wiz port version.

Bittboy-MSX is an adaptation of Dingux-MSX for
Bittboy. S ince it lacks the L/R Trigger 
keys are mapped diffrently.


CONTROL
------------

- Virtual keyboard

In the MSX emulator window 

Normal mapping :

  Bittboy    MSX 

  A          Fire A
  B          Fire B
  TA         F5   
  TB         F1
  Up         Up
  Down       Down
  Left       Left
  Right      Right

Press R        to enter in emulator main menu.
Press START    open/close the virtual keyboard

In the main menu

SELECT     Reset the emulator
A          Valid
B          -
TB         Go Back
TA         Go Back

The On-Screen Keyboard of "Danzel" and "Jeff Chen"

Use digital pad to choose one of the 9 squares, and
use A, B, TA, TB to choose one of the 4 letters of the
highlighted square.

Use SELECT to switch between four virtual keyboard panels.


LOADING MSX ROM FILES
------------

If you want to load rom image in your emulator, you
have to put your rom file (with .zip, .rom, .mx1 or
.mx2 file extension) on your SD memory card in the
'roms' directory.

Then, while inside MSX emulator, just press R to enter
in the emulator main menu, and then using the file 
selector choose one rom file to load in your emulator.

Back to the emulator window, the rom should stard
automatically.

To eject a ROM choose "Eject Rom" inside the
emulator menu.

You can use the virtual keyboard in the file
requester menu to choose the first letter of the
game you search (it might be useful when you have
tons of games in the same folder). 

Entering several time the same letter let you
choose sequentially files beginning with the given
letter. You can use the Run key of the virtual
keyboard to launch the rom.

You may use the SELECT key to swap between the four
virtual keyboard panels (numbers & letters)


LOADING DISK FILES
------------

If you want to load disk image in the virtual drive
A or B of your emulator, you have to put your disk
file (with .dsk file extension, or gzipped disk file
with .dsz file extension) on your SD memory card in
the 'disk' directory.  

Gzipped disk files are not writable.

You proceed as previously described for ROM files,
and your disk is then inserted in the drive 'A' of
your emulator.

To start your disk, you have to choose the "Reset
MSX" option and back to the emulator window, the MSX
should reboot and stard your disk automatically.

You must eject any present rom before starting a
disk, or only the ROM will start instead of your disk
image.
  

LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
------------

For given games, the default keyboard mapping between
Bitboy Keys and MSX keys, is not suitable, and the game
can't be played on Bitbot-MSX.

To overcome the issue, you can write your own
mapping file. Using notepad for example you can edit
a file with the .kbd extension and put it in the kbd
directory.

For the exact syntax of those mapping files, have a
look on sample files already presents in the kbd
directory (default.kbd etc ...).

After writting such keyboard mapping file, you can
load them using the main menu inside the emulator.

If the keyboard filename is the same as the rom
filename (.zip etc ...) then when you load this rom,
the corresponding keyboard file is automatically
loaded !

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load and
save your keyboard mapping files inside the emulator.
The Save option save the .kbd file in the kbd
directory using the "Game Name" as filename. The game
name is displayed on the right corner in the emulator
menu.

If you have saved the state of a game, then a
thumbnail image will be displayed in the file
requester while selecting any file (rom, disk,
keyboard, settings) with game name, to help you to
recognize that game later.

COMMENTS
------------

You can write your own comments for games using the
"Comment" menu.  The first line of your comments
would then be displayed in the file requester menu
while selecting the given file name (snapshot, disk,
keyboard, settings).


CHEAT CODE (.CHT)
----------

  You can use cheat codes with Bittboy-MSX You can add
your own cheat codes in the cheat.txt file and then
import them in the cheat menu.

  All cheat codes you have specified for a game can
be save in a CHT file in 'cht' folder.  Those cheat
codes would then be automatically loaded when you
start the game.

The CHT file format is the following :
#
# Enable, Address, Value, Comment
#
1,36f,3,Cheat comment

Using the Cheat menu you can search for modified
bytes in RAM between current time and the last time
you saved the RAM. It might be very usefull to find
"poke" address by yourself, monitoring for example
life numbers.

To find a new "poke address" you can proceed as
follow :

Let's say you're playing "1942" and you want to find
the memory address where "number lives" is stored.

. Start a new game in 1942
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Choose Save Ram to save initial state of the
  memory. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan Old Value" field.
  (for 1942 the initial lives number is 4)
. Go back to the game and loose 1 life.
. Enter in the cheat menu.
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan New Value" field.
  (for 1942 the lives number is now 3)
. In Add Cheat you have many matching Addresses
. Then go back to the game and loose more lives
  let's say up to 0.
. Enter in the cheat menu.
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan New Value" field.
  (for 1942 the lives number is now 0)
. In Add Cheat you have now only one matching Address
. Specify the Poke value you want (for example 4) 
  and add the new cheat with this address / value.
. Try this cheat while restarting a new game and see
  if the life number is 4 or not. You will see that 
  the good address is 2D2F.

  The cheat is now activated in the cheat list 
  and you can save it using the "Save cheat" menu.

  Let's enjoy 1942 with infinite life !!
